# simple-webserver
A simple webserver to get me back in the groove

So far it can handle get requests for html, css, js, and json.

Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/obee111/simple-webserver.git
npm start
```

Intent is to have a webserver that can do any static website you throw at it

## Tasks

- Run as daemon / create CLI tool
- Image / Video support
- Learn how webservers actually work so I can run this like nginx
- Make config super easy to use
